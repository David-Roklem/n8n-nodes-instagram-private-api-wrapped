## Usage

This node leverages the powerful `instagram-private-api` library to provide access to Instagram's internal APIs, enabling comprehensive automation capabilities.

### ‚ú® **Key Features**

#### **User Management**
```javascript
// Get detailed user profile
{
  "pk": "123456789",
  "username": "example_user",
  "full_name": "Example User",
  "follower_count": 1500,
  "following_count": 300,
  "media_count": 85,
  "is_verified": false,
  "is_private": false,
  "biography": "Content creator and photographer"
}
```

#### **Media Interaction**
- Access to post engagement data (likes, comments)
- Media metadata including dimensions, URLs, captions
- Automated liking/unliking capabilities

#### **Feed Access**
- Personal timeline content
- Real-time feed updates
- Engagement tracking

### üìã **Example Workflows**

1. **Social Media Monitoring**: Track competitor follower growth and engagement
2. **Content Curation**: Automatically collect media from specific users
3. **Engagement Automation**: Like posts from target accounts (use responsibly)
4. **Analytics Collection**: Gather data for social media analysis

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Considerations**

- **Rate Limiting**: Instagram enforces strict rate limits. Use appropriate delays between requests

- **API Stability**: Private APIs may change without notice

### üõ† **Best Practices**

- Implement proper error handling in your workflows
- Use realistic delays between API calls (2-5 seconds minimum)
- Monitor for rate limit responses and implement backoff strategies
- Keep credentials secure and rotate them regularly
